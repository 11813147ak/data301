# Notes in teaching using the IPython Notebook

For notebooks prepared as lectures:

* Keep all main teaching examples as simple as possible. Don't do fancy examples to teach
  students the API and how to code.
* Have separate examples that are more complex.
* Use a consistent structure and organization of notebooks.
* When to print, when to use Output.
* Get rid of the pager so you can put help in notebook cells!!!
* Maybe think about getting numpy doc rendering of docstrings working?!?
* Don't use code comments for the main narrative.
* Minimize visual garbage in code cells - allow the user to focus on the main
  parts of the code, not the extra cruft.
* Link to further documentation often.
* Use the magic number 3 a lot!!!
