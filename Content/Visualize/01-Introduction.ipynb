    "One one side there is a rich body of research literature that approaches data visualization from a formal and principled perspective. On the other side are numerous Python libraries which all offer slightly different ways of expressing visual concepts in code. These libraries are many (Matplotlib, ggplot, Bokeh, Altair, BQPlot, Seaborn, etc.) and they all cover some subset of data visualization quite well. Herein, I will briefly cover foundational results from data visualization research, and then turn quickly to their application by covering two very different visualization libraries: Altair and Matplotlib. These two Python libraries complement each other well, with Altair focusing narrowly on formal statistical visualization and Matplotlib covering everything else."
