    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Data transformation is one of most important phases in the data science process. Data transformation is needed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To bring a raw dataset into the tidy format.\n",
    "2. During the visualization phase to compute groups, aggregations, statistical summaries, etc.\n",
    "3. During the iterative process of *Visualizing* and *Modeling*.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the strength of Python and its various data science packages are their power, flexibility and convenience to transform data. Sometimes Python and its standard library will be sufficient. Other times, we will need more powerful packges such as [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) or [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL). In this section of the course, you will learn how to leverage these tools to transform data."
