      "An operational definition of Data Science answers the question, \"what do Data Scientists do?\". Over the last few years, the community of Data Scientists have been building a concensus answer to this question. The different activities involved in Data Science are linked together to form the Data Science **process** or **workflow**. By looking at the descriptions of the Data Science process by a few individuals, we can start to see a clear picture emerging.\n",
